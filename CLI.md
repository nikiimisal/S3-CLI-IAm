<h1>1. Command‑Line Interface (CLI)</h1>

What it is CLI..?

A Command‑Line Interface is a text-based user interface where you type commands into a terminal or shell to interact with your operating system or applications. It’s one of the oldest types of interfaces, dating back to the 1960s

<h2>Uses</h2>

• System administration (e.g., managing files, users, services).

• Software development (e.g., building projects, version control with tools like git) 

• Cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS CLI for interacting with cloud services) 

• Automation and scripting using shell scripts, piping commands together, environment variables 

• Accessibility: Works well with screen readers and Braille displays..

<h2>Advantages:</h2>

• Fast and powerful—can perform complex tasks in fewer steps than a GUI .

• Lightweight—uses minimal system resources .

• Scriptable—great for automating repetitive tasks.

<h2>Challenges:</h2>

• Steep learning curve due to unfamiliar syntax 

• No "undo": Mistyped commands can lead to serious consequences 

• OS‑specific commands—you can’t always copy-paste between Windows, Linux, or macOS and expect them to work identically

<h1>Setting Up & Getting Started</h1>
<h2>1. open terminal</h2>

• Windows: Search for Command Prompt, PowerShell, or use the newer Windows Terminal 

• macOS: Go to Applications → Utilities → Terminal 

• Linux: Press Ctrl + Alt + T, or open your distro’s terminal emulator (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole) 



<h1>2. Call Level Interface (CLI in Databases)</h1>

Less commonly, CLI also stands for Call Level Interface, a standard API used to embed SQL commands into applications—historically in C or COBOL programs. It defines how applications send SQL queries to databases and handle results. ODBC and JDBC are implementations of this standard
