<h1>AWS S3 _Storage Classes</h1>

<h1>Amazon S3 Storage Classes & Their Uses</h1>
Amazon S3 provides a variety of storage classes designed to accommodate different data access patterns, retention requirements, and budget considerations. These classes let you balance cost, performance, and resilience effectively.

<h2>1. S3 Standard</h2>
• Purpose: Default class for frequently accessed data.

• Highlights: Extremely durable (11 9’s), highly available (~99.99%), with low latency and high throughput.

• Ideal for: Cloud apps, dynamic websites, real-time analytics, mobile/gaming content.

<h2>2. S3 Intelligent‑Tiering</h2>

• Purpose: For data with unknown or changing access patterns.

• Highlights: Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent tiers with minimal latency impact. Lowers cost through automation (monitoring fee applies).

• Ideal for: Data lakes, user-generated content, or analytics where access is unpredictable.

<h2>3. S3 Standard‑IA (Infrequent Access)</h2>

• Purpose: For data accessed occasionally but needing quick retrieval.

• Highlights: Same durability as Standard, slightly lower availability (~99.9%), lower storage cost but retrieval fees.

• Ideal for: Backups, disaster recovery, infrequently accessed but critical data.

<h2>4. S3 One Zone‑IA</h2>

• Purpose: Low-cost storage for infrequent access, without multi-AZ redundancy.

• Highlights: Stores data in a single Availability Zone—~20% cheaper than Standard‑IA; durability remains 11 9’s, availability lower (~99.5%).

• Ideal for: Re-creatable secondary backups or non-critical data.

<h2>5. S3 Glacier Classes (Archive Tier)</h2>

<h3>a. Glacier Instant Retrieval</h3>

• Purpose: Archive storage with millisecond retrieval.
• Highlights: Lower storage costs, slightly higher access fees, minimum storage duration (90 days).
• Ideal for: Medical images, media archives needing fast access

<h3>b. Glacier Flexible Retrieval</h3>

• Purpose: Cost-efficient long-term archive.
• Highlights: Retrieval options (expedited minutes, standard hours, bulk up to 12 hours), minimum 90-day retention.
• Ideal for: Regulatory backups, disaster recovery where access can tolerate delay.

<h3>c. Glacier Deep Archive</h3>

• Purpose: Long-term data archiving at the lowest cost.
• Highlights: Retrieval in 12–48 hours, minimum 180-day duration.
• Ideal for: Compliance archives, rarely accessed records.

<h2>6. S3 Express One Zone</h2>

• Purpose: High-performance storage within a single AZ.
• Highlights: Optimized for ultra-low latency and throughput; best for analytics and ML workloads within a specific region.

<h2>7. S3 on Outposts</h2>

• Purpose: On-premises S3-compatible storage for data residency and local access.
• Highlights: Supports familiar S3 APIs and encryption options; exclusive to Outposts environments.

| Storage Class            | Best For                          | Retrieval Speed | Durable | AZ Redundancy        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| **Standard**             | Active data                       | Milliseconds    | 11 9’s  | Multi-AZ             |
| **Intelligent‑Tiering**  | Unpredictable access              | Milliseconds    | 11 9’s  | Multi-AZ             |
| **Standard‑IA**          | Infrequent but important data     | Milliseconds    | 11 9’s  | Multi-AZ             |
| **One Zone‑IA**          | Non-critical infrequent data      | Milliseconds    | 11 9’s  | Single AZ            |
| **Glacier Instant**      | Archive w/ fast access            | Milliseconds    | 11 9’s  | Multi-AZ             |
| **Glacier Flexible**     | Archived with delayed retrieval   | Minutes–Hours   | 11 9’s  | Multi-AZ             |
| **Glacier Deep Archive** | Long-term compliance storage      | 12–48 hours     | 11 9’s  | Multi-AZ             |
| **Express One Zone**     | High-throughput localized compute | Milliseconds    | —       | Single AZ            |
| **S3 on Outposts**       | On-prem workflow                  | S3 API speed    | —       | Localized (Outposts) |


<h2>How to Choose & Manage Storage Classes</h2>

<h3>1. Understand Access Patterns</h3>

  Use tools like S3 Storage Class Analysis and Storage Lens to monitor data access.

  <h3>2. Automate with Lifecycle Rules</h3>

  Set rules to transition data—for example, from Standard to Standard‑IA or Glacier—based on age.

  <h3>3. Set During Upload or Change Later</h3>

  You can specify a storage class when uploading or modify existing objects via console, CLI, SDK, or lifecycle policies.
