<h1>What Is S3 Static Website Hosting?</h1>

Amazon S3 static website hosting lets you host webpages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) directly from an S3 bucket—no web servers needed. S3 handles content delivery over HTTP, making it ideal for simple, cost-effective static sites.

<h2>Benefits include:</h2>

• Highly scalable and available: Built on S3’s infrastructure, it scales to thousands of requests and offers 99.999999999% durability.

• Low maintenance and cost: No servers to manage; just upload files.

• Affordable: Ideal for hosting blogs, company sites, portfolios, and documentation.

<h2>When and Why You’d Use It</h2>

• Hosting documentation, portfolios, simple informational websites, or single-page apps.

• No backend logic: purely static content (HTML/CSS/JS).

• Want to avoid managing infrastructure while ensuring global availability.

<h2>Step-by-Step: How to Set Up S3 Static Website Hosting</h2>

<h3>1. Create an S3 Bucket</h3>

• Open the AWS Console and go to S3.

• Click Create bucket, name it (preferably same as your domain, e.g., example.com), choose region.

<h3>2. Enable Static Website Hosting</h3>

• In the bucket, go to Properties > Static website hosting > Edit.

• Choose “Use this bucket to host a website,” set the Index document (e.g., index.html) and optional Error document. Save changes.

• This generates a website endpoint URL for testing.

<h3>3. Make Content Public</h3>

• Under Permissions, turn off Block all public access.

• (Optional) Add a bucket policy to allow public read access if using root domain or access issues.

<h3>4. Upload Your Site Files</h3>

• Upload index.html, 404.html, and other assets via the Console

<h3>5. Link a Custom Domain (Optional But I personaly prefer)</h3>

• Use Route 53: create a hosted zone for your domain.

• Add an Alias A record pointing your domain (or www) to the S3 website endpoint. Must match bucket name and domain.

<h3>6. Add HTTPS via CloudFront (Highly Recommended)</h3>

S3 only supports HTTP—modern sites require HTTPS. The solution:

• Create a CloudFront distribution with your S3 website as the origin.

• Enable HTTPS and use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for TLS certs.

• Point your domain to CloudFront in Route 53 instead of S3 directly.

>>NOTE :<br>
“Nowadays, no one should be using S3 for website hosting without CloudFront.”
